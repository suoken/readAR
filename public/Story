Once upon a time, there was a lost puppy who just needed a friend. He went up to a dragon and said: “Dragon, would you be my friend?” The dragon replied, “No! I’m going to eat you!”
So the lost puppy went along, he came across a fox. He went up to the fox and said: “Fox, will you be my friend?” The fox said angrily: “Friend? You look disgusting and old.” The puppy hurried along disappointedly. He curled up into a ball and weeped. 

Out of nowhere, a soft voice woke up the puppy: “Are you okay?” He looked up, “No, I just wanted a friend who likes me for who I am.”

“Come with me, I will be your friend.” said the Princess.

And they lived happily ever after.
